  <h1>Hello everyone, this is a page about me and my IT life</h1>
    <p> I am excited to actually learn stuff. I realized how important it is to understand how the 
	IT world works and its many different approaches before jumping into the deeper end of the pool.
	<br>

	    <li> - Front end development</li>
		<li> - Back end development</li>
		  <ul style="list-style-type: circle"> 
		    <li>(But this one is a little scarier to think about)</li>
